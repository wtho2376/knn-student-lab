# KNN for Beginners

A minimal, hands-on introduction to the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm for high school to first-year college students.

## 🚀 Live Demo
Open the interactive webpage directly in your browser:
> **https://wtho2376.github.io/knn-student-lab**

*(Note: GitHub Pages may take 1-2 minutes to activate after enabling it in repo settings.)*

## What's here?
- `index.html`: Interactive webpage with tabbed Python & R examples
- `python/knn_example.py`: Standalone Python script (uses `scikit-learn`)
- `r/knn_example.R`: Standalone R script (uses `class` library)

All examples use the classic Iris dataset and `k=3` — simple enough for beginners, but functional enough to learn from.

## How to run locally
### Python
```bash
pip install scikit-learn numpy
python python/knn_example.py
```

### R
```r
install.packages("class")
Rscript r/knn_example.R
```

## Next Steps
We’ll expand this repo with:
- Data visualizations (Python `matplotlib` / R `ggplot2`)
- Practice exercises and challenges
- Jupyter Notebooks/R Markdown tutorials
- Step-by-step explanations of KNN concepts
